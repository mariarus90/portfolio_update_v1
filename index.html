        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> Here I should write a story about what has led me to do what I do, but I think the clients don't care about my personal aspirations because they are all about the mula so let's get to the point! good design and good ux makes YOU more money, so you need me!</p>
        <p> Nothing will triger an positive emotional reponce for the end user if it's not designed. Please take that in consideration because in 2017 everything is already buil, are they used? NO because the UX makes the difference. UX also means - efficiency and usage, mind that please.</p>
